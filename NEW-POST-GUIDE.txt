STEP 1 — Duplicate post-template.html
  In GitHub, open post-template.html
  Click the ··· menu → "Copy file"
  Name it something like:  my-post-title.html
  (use dashes, no spaces, e.g. "stop-pretending.html")

STEP 2 — Edit the 4 marked spots in the new file
  Look for lines that start with  ✏️ EDIT:
  Change the tag, title, date, and read time.

STEP 3 — Replace the post body
  Find the <article class="post-body"> section
  Delete the example paragraphs
  Paste in your writing, wrapping each paragraph in <p>...</p>

  For section headers:    <h2>Your header</h2>
  For pull quotes:        <blockquote>Your quote</blockquote>
  For dividers:           <hr>
  For italics:            <em>word</em>

STEP 4 — Add it to the homepage (index.html)
  Find the "Recent" side posts section
  Copy one of the <a class="side-post"> blocks
  Update the tag, title, and href to your new filename
  (e.g. href="stop-pretending.html")
